This flow is designed to continually re-add you to the raid lobby 
before the countdown expires in Pokemon Go. The idea is to make 
your presence in the raid visible to others in the hope that they 
will join. Like the other flows, it is activated by pressing the 
volume down button. To stop the flow, press the volume up button.
This flow is designed to work with the free version of the Automate app by LlamaLab.
