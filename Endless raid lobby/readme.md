## Endless raid lobby:

This flow is designed to continually re-add you to the raid lobby in Pokemon Go before the countdown expires. Here's how it works:

1. **Start**: Press the volume down button to activate the flow. The idea is to make your presence in the raid visible to others in the hope that they will join.

2. **Operation**: The flow will automatically re-add you to the raid lobby before the countdown expires.

3. **End**: You can cancel the flow at any time by pressing the volume up button. To stop the flow, you need to manually stop it in the Automate app.

### Features

- **Cancel**: You can cancel the flow at any time by pressing the volume up button.
- **Restart**: If you wish to restart the flow, simply press the volume down button again.

This flow is designed to work with the free version of the Automate app by LlamaLab.
