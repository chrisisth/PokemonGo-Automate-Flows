This flow is designed to automate the process of sending gifts in Pokemon Go. 
It is activated by pressing the volume down button. Once activated, the flow will 
automatically send gifts within the game. For this you need to be in the friend 
list and have at least send one gift with a preffered sticker. To stop the flow, 
press the volume up button. Upon stopping, the flow will provide a brief summary 
indicating the number of times it has run. This flow is 
designed to work with the free version of the Automate app by LlamaLab.
