## Pokemon gift exchange

This flow is designed to automate the process of opening and sending gifts in Pokemon Go. Here's how it works:

1. **Start**: Press the volume down button to activate the flow. For this to work, you need to be in the friend list and have sent at least one gift with a preferred sticker.

2. **Operation**: The flow will automatically open and send gifts within the game.

3. **End**: To stop the operation, simply press the volume up button. Upon stopping, the flow will provide a brief summary indicating the number of times it has run.

### Features

- **Cancel**: You can cancel the flow at any time by pressing the volume up button.
- **Restart**: If you wish to restart the flow, simply press the volume down button again.

This flow is designed to work with the free version of the Automate app by LlamaLab.
