## Pokemon Trade Automation

This flow is designed to automate the process of trading Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Here's how it works:

1. **Setup**: Perform a trade manually in Pokemon Go, setting up a search string within the game. After the first trade, ensure the player profile (where the trade button is visible) is open on both devices.

2. **Start**: Press the volume down button on both devices simultaneously to activate the flow. A notification will appear to confirm the start of the process.

3. **Operation**: The flow will automatically perform trades based on the initial setup. It will continue to trade until you stop it.

4. **End**: To stop the flow, you need to manually stop it in the Automate app.

### Features

- **Cancel**: You can cancel the flow at any time by pressing the volume up button.
- **Restart**: If you wish to restart the flow, simply press the volume down button again.

This flow is designed to work with the free version of the Automate app by LlamaLab.
