This flow is designed to work in conjunction with the CalcIV auto scanner to automate 
the process of scanning Pokemon and renaming them based on the nickname profile set in CalcIV. 
It is activated by pressing the volume down button. Once activated, the flow will automatically 
scan Pokemon and rename them within the game. This flow only provides an output at the start. 
To stop the flow, press the volume up button.
This flow is designed to work with the free version of the Automate app by LlamaLab.
